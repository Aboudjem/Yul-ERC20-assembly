# Yul-ERC20-Assembly :fire: :rocket:

Welcome to the **Yul-ERC20-Assembly** repository, a high-performance, low-level ERC-20 token contract written using inline Assembly / Yul for EVM interactions! This project leverages the power of Foundry, a smart contract development toolchain that streamlines your workflow with dependency management, compilation, testing, deployment, and more. :sparkles:

## :computer: What is Yul-ERC20-Assembly?

The Yul-ERC20-Assembly project is a groundbreaking implementation of an ERC20 token contract that utilizes inline Yul Assembly to maximize performance and reduce gas costs. As an amazing and skilled Solidity EVM developer, I've crafted this repository to showcase a unique and efficient approach to token contract development. :muscle:

git clone https://github.com/aboudjem/Yul-ERC20-Assembly.git
cd Yul-ERC20-Assembly

``` 

2.  Compile the contract:

```
forge compile
``` 

3.  Run tests:


```
forge test
```
